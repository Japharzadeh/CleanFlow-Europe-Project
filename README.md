PFAS Surface Water Analysis

This repository contains an analytical study of PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances) contamination in European surface waters based on data collected between 2003 and 2019 across 34 countries. The project includes statistical analysis, spatial modeling, and visualization of PFAS concentration patterns.

Key Objectives

Evaluate PFAS concentration levels across all available samples

Identify geographic patterns and high-risk regions

Analyze temporal trends and long-term changes

Provide reproducible code and transparent methodology

Contents

Data preprocessing scripts

Statistical analysis and modeling notebooks

Visualization tools (trend charts, heatmaps, mapping outputs)

Documentation of methods and assumptions

Importance

PFAS are highly persistent environmental contaminants with growing implications for public health and ecosystem integrity. This project aims to support evidence-based monitoring strategies and scientific understanding of their distribution.
